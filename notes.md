#####  Some of the common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top-level content body. The body has three children, a header, a main, and footer. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.
