##### I learned many things from this assignment, mainly, I learned how to commit changes push them, and pull them. It is similar to saving a backup of your work, but this also allows others to collaborate in a group-like manner.

#####  Some of the common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top-level content body. The body has three children, a header, a main, and footer. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

##### Learned how to use CSS sheets in conjunction with Bootstrap to make a design that was both clean and functional. Used various tags: header{}. p{}, and id tags including #. Bootstrap allowed me to added quality designs by bringing in the link through an href.
