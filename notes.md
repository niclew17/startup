# Notes

##### I learned many things from this assignment, mainly, I learned how to commit changes push them, and pull them. It is similar to saving a backup of your work, but this also allows others to collaborate in a group-like manner.

#####  Some of the common HTML structural elements include body, header, footer, main, section aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, and span. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top-level content body. The body has three children, a header, a main, and footer. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

##### Learned how to use CSS sheets in conjunction with Bootstrap to make a design that was both clean and functional. Used various tags: header{}. p{}, and id tags including #. Bootstrap allowed me to added quality designs by bringing in the link through an href.

- In the following code, what does the link element do?
  + The <link>" tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.

  + The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

- In the following code,  what does a div tag do?
  + The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document

- In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector?
- In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?
  + Margin: It is the space around an element. Margins are used to move an element up or down on a page as well as left or right. Margin is completely transparent, and it does not have any background color. It clears the area around the element. Each side of the element has a margin size you can change individually. In creating the gap, the margin pushes adjacent elements away.
  + Padding: It is the space between the element and the related content inside it. It determines how elements look and sit within a container. It also shows the container background around the element in it. Padding can be affected by background colors as it clears the area around the content. To create the gap, it either grows the element size or shrinks the content inside. By default, the size of the element increases.
